### How can we move it to internet?

Frontend

    1. Go for hybrid app development like react-native, flutter
        1. One codebase and develop for multiple platform
        2. Fast development with once pass the learning curve line
    2. Native platform development, 
        1. will give you fast development with minimal learning 
        2. Multiple codebases and team depedancies/involvement
    3. There are several pros and cons associated with native vs hybrid
    4. IMO, It is better to start with hybrid one for phase 1, where more focus is on deliverable. Move fast and break things.

Backend

    1. For phase 1, we're not much worried about traffic, as mentioned it is about delivering the product. So marketing team can do thier job.
    2. We can use cloud services & fasten up development with servless approach
        1. API Gateway for microservices
        2. Socket with multiplayer support, chat https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html
        3. DynamoDB or RDS for persistent datastore
    3. Again, there set up of challenges with serverless architecture like cost related (lambda warm up & boot time)
    4. It better to setup alerts on the billing metrics, act accordingly by choosing right stack after seeing actie user growth
